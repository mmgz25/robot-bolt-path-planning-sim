# robot-bolt-path-planning-sim
Final Project for ME556 Robotics. 
This final project aims to simulate a robot that uses computer vision to identify a pattern of bolts and navigate to each bolt within reach following the most efficient path. The robot will be stationary and return to a home position after completion of the task. 

This code simulates a SCARA robot in 2D where CV is used to identify a bolt pattern on a flat object and TSP path planning is used to navigate to all bolts within reach.
